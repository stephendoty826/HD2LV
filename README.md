# Helldivers 2 Loadouts

changing something

### “A Helldiver Without a Loadout Is Just a Corpse in Uniform.” - General Brasch, Super Ten-Star General

In service of Liberty, welcome to the Loadout Vault.

This is your armory, Helldiver — a place to craft, save, and perfect your loadouts for every righteous mission across the galaxy. Whether you're dropping into a bug-infested warzone or dismantling bot resistance one stratagem at a time, your gear is your greatest weapon in the fight for Managed Democracy.

Customize your arsenal. Prepare for deployment. And show the enemies of Super Earth what true freedom looks like.

Remember: Liberty isn’t given — it’s dropped from orbit with extreme prejudice.
