# Helldivers 2 Loadouts

### “A Helldiver Without a Loadout Is Just a Corpse in Uniform.” - General Brasch, Super Ten-Star General

In service of Liberty, this Loadout Vault has been engineered to support the brave men and women of the Helldivers program in their righteous mission to spread Managed Democracy across the galaxy. Customize and preserve your most effective instruments of peace, then deploy them with ruthless efficiency against the enemies of freedom — be they bug, bot, or squid.

Each loadout you create is a declaration of loyalty, forged in the fires of patriotic duty and optimized for the frontlines of Super Earth’s eternal struggle. Whether you're liberating a bug-infested hellscape or reclaiming a bot-controlled outpost, your gear choices can mean the difference between glorious victory and unacceptable dissent.

Remember: Liberty is not given — it is delivered, via orbital strike if necessary. Your loadout is your weapon. Your weapon is the will of Super Earth.
